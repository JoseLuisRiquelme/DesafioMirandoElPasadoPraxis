💡 Exercise 1
(2.5 Points)

During a video call party, your friend starts reminiscing nostalgically about the past and asks if you remember brands that once existed. As a programming enthusiast, you decide to pull out your shiny notebook and code a Java application to list brands that live in your memories. To help your friend, you decide to do the following:

Instantiate an ArrayList<String> named “brands” to generate a list of brands.
Add 10 brands that you have known and print them to the console using System.out.println.
Your friend remembers 3 more brands and asks if you can add them to the list. The brands to add are “Blokbaster”, “Carrefour”, and “Jetix”. Print the updated list to the console.
You realize that “Blokbaster” should actually be spelled “Blockbuster” and decide to update the list with the correct spelling.
Unfortunately, you notice that “Carrefour” still exists and decide to remove it from the list. To do this, you should remove the 11th element and print the updated list to the screen. You can use the .remove("Carrefour") function to see if the element was removed correctly, as it will return true if the removal was successful.
Inspired, you decide to create a separate collection of brands that might be out of the market. To do this, add some brands (any you like) to a new ArrayList<String> named “potentialBrands” and merge them into the “brands” list.
Around 11 PM, you decide to count how many elements are in the list. Use your knowledge to count the number of elements in the list and print it to the screen.
💾 Exercise 2
(2.5 Points)

Since the party didn’t end there, and after a lot of laughter, you remember some old schoolmates and decide to list them with the idea of contacting them and inviting them to a post-pandemic party. Tired of using ArrayList<>, you decide to use Set<>(). To do this, you:

Instantiate a Set<String> named “guests” to generate a list of schoolmates. You mention to your friend that they can use something called TreeSet<>() to list them in an ordered way.
After many memories, you decide to add the following names: “Daniel”, “Paola”, “Facundo”, “Pedro”, ”Jacinta”, “Florencia”, and “Juan Pablo”.
Your friend remembers 3 more old schoolmates but asks if you can add them to a separate list of “potential guests” as they weren’t very well-liked. The “potential guests” are “Jorge”, “Francisco”, and “Marcos”. Create this new list, merge it with the other, and print it to the screen.
Unfortunately, you realize it’s better not to invite “Jorge” and decide to remove him from the list. Print the final list of guests so you can start contacting them as soon as possible.
📈 Exercise 3
(2.5 Points)

However, the party didn't end there. You found a list of the old prices of some childhood candies on the internet and decide to create a Map<>() to wrap up the party.

Instantiate a Map<String, Integer> named “candies” to generate a list of these. You mention to your friend that you would like to try something called TreeMap() to list them by keys.
You decide to add the following candies:
Chocman at 100 pesos
Trululú at 100 pesos
Centella at 100 pesos
Kilate at 50 pesos
Miti-miti at 30 pesos
Traga Traga at 150 pesos
Tabletón at 5 pesos
Your friend asks if it’s possible to filter those candies that cost less than 100 pesos to show on social media the value of money over time.
🎮 Exercise 4
(2.5 Points)

Finally, and not least, you remembered those childhood games with your friend. While chatting, you realize that you could list them using a Queue. So you decide to do the following:

Instantiate a Queue<String> named “games” with something called LinkedList() to enqueue them.
You decide to add the following games: Tombo, Freeze Tag, Dodgeball, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tag.
Given the late hour of the video call, you decide to simply count the number of games and print them to the screen for a future occasion when you might play them again.
This structured approach with sections and clear task breakdown should help you tackle the challenge effectively. Good luck!
